  Messaging related changes:
  - Use CACHE_CONSUMER by default for ESB RR
  - Don't use JMSXDeliveryCount to determine whether message has already been processed
  - Added maxDeliveries
  - Delay wasn't increased when unable to write to error store (it was reset on every new try)
  - Don't call session.rollback() when isTransacted() (it was also called in afterMessageProcessed when message was moved to error store)
  - Some cleaning along the way like making some synchronized statements unnecessary
  - Made BTM and ActiveMQ work for testing purposes
